I loved how writing code helped me to think more logically and creatively. Since then, I've continued to learn new programming languages and apply my skills to a variety of projects, including data science. I'm excited to use my programming skills to build data-driven apps that will help people make better decisions!"

Hello! I'm an explorer at heart, with a background in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New South Wales and Industrial Engineer at ULACIT. Along the way, I discovered the captivating realm of data science. Armed with skills in Python, Rstudio, SQL, and more, I've delved into the realms of Predictive Modeling, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. My journey has led me to libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch, and I've embraced coding languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java. Beyond the screen, I'm an outdoor enthusiast, a sports aficionado with a keen eye on football and tennis, and a curious soul drawn to artistic pursuits. Join me on this data-driven journey!
