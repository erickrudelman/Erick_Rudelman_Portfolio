The Simple Stock Price App is a streamlined application built using Streamlit and Yahoo Finance (yfinance) to display historical stock data of Google (GOOGL). The app aims to present the closing price and volume of Google's stock in an easily accessible and visually informative manner.

When you run the app, it generates the following features:

A bold title that introduces the app as the "Simple Stock Price App."

The stock data visualization: The app showcases two line charts that display the closing price and volume of Google's stock over time. These line charts are generated using historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance. The x-axis represents the timeline (from 2010-05-21 to 2023-05-31), and the y-axis represents the stock closing price and trading volume, respectively.

Overall, the app provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and understand the historical trends in Google's stock price and trading volume.

**Stocks:**

Stocks, also known as shares or equities, represent ownership in a company. When you own a stock of a company, you become a shareholder, which means you have a claim to a portion of the company's assets and earnings. Stocks are bought and sold on stock exchanges, and their prices can fluctuate based on various factors, including company performance, market trends, economic conditions, and investor sentiment.

Investors buy stocks with the expectation that the value of the stock will increase over time, allowing them to earn a profit by selling the stock at a higher price than they initially paid. Additionally, some stocks pay dividends, which are a portion of the company's profits distributed to shareholders.

Stock data includes various attributes such as opening price, closing price, high and low prices during a trading day, trading volume, dividends, and stock splits. Analyzing historical stock data can provide insights into a company's financial health, investor sentiment, and overall market trends.
