**Project background and context**

SpaceX is the only private company to
ever return a spacecraft from low-earth
orbit. This is due to their capability to
reuse the first stage of their rocket. For
SpaceX, rocket launches are relatively
inexpensive. For this project, data science
techniques are applied in order to build a
pipeline and determine meaningful
insights if another company wants to
compete against Space X. 

**Relevant data will be obtained to predict outcomes such as:**
• Price of launch
• If first stage will land successfully or not

**Methodology**

**Data collection methodology**
• Data was collected using the get.response() function from the SpaceX API

**Perform datawrangling**

•Cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data. Also, creating new features or modifying existing ones to extract relevant information from the data

**Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization andSQL**

**Perform interactive visual analytics using Folium andPlotlyDash**

**Perform predictive analysis using classification models**
• Build and train the classification model to make predictions on the dataset. Models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors are evaluated
